<p>This project has been designed to offer a practical learning experience and enhance my understanding of MongoDB CRUD operator, AXIOS, JWT, Admin dashboard, Instructor dashboard, Student dashboard, reactQuery, and Private Routes. By working on this project, I have gained practical knowledge and proficiency in these areas. It helped me learn how to integrate Firebase into my application, utilize Auth Providers for user authentication, and implement Private Routes to restrict access to certain pages or features based on user authentication status. This practical approach deepened my understanding and allowed me to effectively apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.</p>
